# Migration Guide

## v0.x to v1

### Resium are fully reimplemented

New component lifecycle and new React Context API in React v16.3 are supported.

There are possibilities that the behavior has changed in edge cases.

### Changed: Entity description

Children of Entity component are no longer rendered as description. Use `EntityDescription` component instead.

Before:

```jsx
import { Viewer, Entity } from "resium";

const Component = () => (
  <Viewer>
    <Entity>
      <h1>Hello, world</h1>
      <p>This is test</p>
    </Entity>
  </Viewer>
);
```

After:

```jsx
import { Viewer, Entity, EntityDescription } from "resium";

const Component = () => (
  <Viewer>
    <Entity>
      <EntityDescription>
        <h1>Hello, world</h1>
        <p>This is test</p>
      </EntityDescription>
    </Entity>
  </Viewer>
);
```

Now only `EntityDescription` depends on `react-dom`.

### Decrepated: PropType

PropType is no longer used. TypeScript is recommended.

### Renamed / Decrepated: properties

See [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/darwin-education/resium/tree/master/CHANGELOG.md).

#### `url` or `czml` prop of Kml/Czml/GeoJsonDataSource

They have been integrated to `data` prop. Now `data` prop accepts URL string, Cesium.Resouce, and data object.

#### `onMount`, `onUpdate` and `onUnmount` prop

`onMount`, `onUpdate` and `onUnmount` prop have been deprecated as they violate React's custom. Use `ref` prop instead.

Before:

```jsx
const Component = () => (
  <Viewer
    onMount={viewer => {
      // some code
    }}
  />
);
```

After:

```jsx
class Component extends React.PureComponent {
  ref = React.createRef();

  componentDidMount() {
    if (ref.current) {
      const viewer = ref.current.cesiumElement;
      // some code
    }
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <Viewer ref={this.ref} />
    );
  }
);
```
