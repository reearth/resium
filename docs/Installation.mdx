# Installation

## 1. Install cesium and resium

You can install `cesium` and `resium` from npm.

```sh
npm install --save cesium resium
# or
yarn add cesium resium
```

**Note**: If you are using TypeScript, install `@types/cesium` also. Installing `@types/resium` is unnecessary as type definitions for Resium are built-in.

## 2. Set up webpack configuration

To use Cesium in webpack environment, preparation is a bit more necessary, because Cesium includes many asset files and uses AMD as module system.

There are some choices. Choose one.

1. If you are using `create-react-app`, [`craco-cesium`](https://github.com/darwin-education/craco-cesium) is recommended. (easiest)
2. [Copy whole Cesium files and load Cesium in HTML](/installation1) (easier)
3. [Copy only asset files and load Cesium partially](/installation2)

## 3. Ready

Everything is ready! Advance to [Getting Started](/getting_started).
